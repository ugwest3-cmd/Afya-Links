1️⃣ The Big Picture — How the Entire Platform Works
Afya Links is a controlled B2B medicine sourcing and logistics coordination system.
It connects:
• Verified Clinics / Drug Shops
• Verified Pharmacies
• Verified Drivers
• Platform Admin
The platform does not:
• Hold stock
• Handle medicine payments
• Handle delivery cash
It only:
• Controls order flow
• Controls information visibility
• Controls driver assignment
• Tracks delivery confirmation
• Generates invoices to pharmacies
Think of it as a transaction orchestrator + compliance layer.
2️⃣ Clinic App — How It Works
Purpose:
Allows clinics to source medicines from verified pharmacies efficiently.
How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1. Registration & Verification
• Clinic registers with phone number (OTP).
• Uploads license + business documents.
• Admin verifies.
• Once verified → clinic can place orders.
No verification = no ordering.
2. Creating an Order
Clinic:
• Searches drug name.
• Enters quantity.
• Optionally attaches prescription.
• Selects preferred pharmacies (e.g., 2 pharmacies).
System:
• Pulls pharmacy prices from latest uploaded CSV.
• Shows clinic hidden offers (only for this order).
Important: Clinic cannot see global pharmacy price lists. Prices are shown only within active order context.
3. Order Selection
Clinic sees:
• Pharmacy A → UGX X
• Pharmacy B → UGX Y
• Stock availability
Clinic selects one pharmacy. Order becomes locked to that pharmacy.
4. Order Tracking
Status flow inside clinic app:
• Pending pharmacy response
• Accepted
• Driver assigned
• In transit
• Delivered
Clinic receives push notifications at each stage.
5. Delivery Confirmation
Driver arrives. Clinic:
• Verifies package
• Pays driver cash (fixed delivery fee)
• Enters unique order code in app
If code matches → order marked Delivered.
This prevents fake delivery claims.
3️⃣ Pharmacy App — How It Works
Purpose:
Allows pharmacies to receive structured orders and earn revenue through controlled supply.
1. Registration & Verification
• Upload pharmacy license
• Upload business registration
• Admin verifies
• Only verified pharmacies receive orders
2. Price List Upload
Pharmacy uploads CSV file:
drug_name, strength, unit, price, stock 
System:
• Validates format
• Sets 48-hour TTL
• Makes it available for order pricing
Pharmacy can update anytime.
Old prices auto-expire.
3. Receiving Orders
When clinic submits order:
Pharmacy sees:
• Drug list
• Quantities
• Attached prescription (if any)
Pharmacy can:
• Accept (full)
• Partial Accept (remove unavailable items)
• Reject (with reason)
4. Order Code Attachment
Once accepted:
System generates unique order code.
Pharmacy:
• Attaches code physically to package.
• Marks “Ready for Pickup.”
This is critical security control.
5. After Delivery
Pharmacy does NOT receive delivery cash. Clinic pays driver.
Platform later generates weekly invoice to pharmacy for:
• Order commission
• Delivery fee commission
Pharmacy uploads payment proof. Admin verifies.
If unpaid → pharmacy blocked.
4️⃣ Driver System — How It Works (SMS Model)
This is intentionally simple.
Drivers:
• Do NOT need smartphones.
• Do NOT need data.
• Do NOT need app.
1. Recruitment
Driver provides:
• ID
• Vehicle details
• Agrees to fixed delivery fee per region
Driver agrees: “I accept UGX X per delivery in this region.”
This prevents negotiation chaos.
2. Assignment
When pharmacy marks order ready:
Admin/system assigns nearest verified driver.
Driver receives SMS:
Pickup: Pharmacy Name, Address Drop: Clinic Address Order Code: XXXX Contact numbers included 
Pharmacy also gets SMS with driver details.
3. Delivery
Driver:
• Picks up package.
• Delivers to clinic.
• Collects fixed delivery fee in cash.
Platform does not touch money.
5️⃣ Admin Web App — How It Works
This is the control center.
Admin can:
• Verify users
• View all orders
• Assign drivers manually
• View delivery status
• Generate invoices
• Approve payment proofs
• Block non-paying pharmacies
Admin also sees:
• Orders per region
• Delivery completion rate
• Revenue reports
• Driver performance
Without admin dashboard, platform collapses.
6️⃣ How All Apps Work Together (System Flow)
Let’s connect everything:
Step 1:
Clinic creates order → selects pharmacy.
Step 2:
Pharmacy accepts → attaches order code.
Step 3:
System assigns driver → sends SMS.
Step 4:
Driver picks up → delivers.
Step 5:
Clinic pays driver → confirms code in app.
Step 6:
Order marked Delivered.
Step 7:
System calculates:
• Pharmacy commission
• Delivery commission
Step 8:
Weekly invoice generated.
Step 9:
Pharmacy uploads proof → Admin verifies.
7️⃣ Revenue Control Logic
Revenue comes from:
• % commission on drug subtotal
• % commission on delivery fee
Pharmacy pays platform weekly.
If pharmacy does not pay:
System automatically blocks:
• New order acceptance
This creates enforcement without handling cash.

9️⃣ System Architecture in Simple Terms
Apps → Backend API → Database
SMS Gateway → Driver
Push Notifications → Clinics/Pharmacies
Admin Dashboard → Full control
Everything passes through backend.
No peer-to-peer direct control.
Final Summary
Clinic App → Creates demand
Pharmacy App → Supplies medicine
Driver (SMS) → Handles logistics
Admin App → Controls and enforces
Backend → Orchestrates everything
Afya Links is not a marketplace only. It is a controlled medical order orchestration platform with logistics coordination and commission enforcement.
